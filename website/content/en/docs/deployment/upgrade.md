Kubeflow does not natively offer an upgrade process. An in-place upgrade often works, but we recommend a blue/green upgrade process that provides a fail-back capability. We will leverage integration with AWS storage and database services to let us deploy a new EKS cluster with Kubeflow and connect it to the external data stores. We will also use an open-source tool to copy certain resources from the production EKS cluster to the new one, and use AWS Backup to snapshot the state of our external data stores.

## Configure Velero in production cluster

First, we will configure Velero in the production cluster. Create an S3 bucket to use in the same region as the production EKS cluster. Edit the file `sample.auto.tfvars` and specify the name of the S3 bucket to use:

```
velero_bucket=<velero bucket>
```

Now deploy the change:

```bash
cd $REPO_ROOT/deployments/rds-s3/terraform
make deploy
```

## Deploy backup EKS cluster

Next, we will create a new `tfvars` file with the name of the backup cluster.

```bash
cd $REPO_ROOT/deployments/upgrade/terraform
cp ../../rds-s3/terraform/sample.auto.tfvars .
```

Edit the `sample.auto.tfvars` file and set the name of the backup EKS cluster in the `cluster_name` variable. The other variables can stay the same.

Now deploy the backup cluster.

```bash
make deploy
```
